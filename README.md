# RFID Door Lock with Arduino

In this project we used serial RFID card reader to read RFID cards. Led' s are blinking by twos when stanby. When reader reads a card all leds become ON and door relay become open. 

## Hardware

* Arduino Nano
* Serial RFID Reader
* 4 * LED
* 12V Door Lock
* 5V Realy

## Software

In software we used only Arduino. Need no library. Only need Serial class and some string process.
